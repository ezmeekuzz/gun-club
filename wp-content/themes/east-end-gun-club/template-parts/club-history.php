                    <p>The East End Rod & Gun Club (EERGC) Was Incorporated On July 16, 1947.  It Was Started By Harold Otto (President), Geo Heller (Vice President), And Vic Nyrgren (Secretary/Treasurer). The Objective Was The Promotion Of The Conservation Of Our Natural Resources, Hunter Safety Education, The Relations Between Sportspeople And Landowners, And Shooting Sports Among The Citizens Of Our Community.</p>
                    <p>The Club (EERGC) Has Since Seen Its Purpose Move To Provide A Safe Facility For The Pursuit Of A Number Of Sports And Self-Defense Shooting Disciplines, But Most Importantly, To Provide Education In Firearms Safety And Ethics To New Shooters.  An Invaluable Component Of This Mission Is The Exposure Of New Shooters To Positive Role Models In Organized Competitive Shooting Events Open To The Public, Which Provide A Better Knowledge Of Safe Handling And Proper Care Of Firearms, As Well As Improved Marksmanship.  We Are Also Proud To Provide A Safe Facility For General Firearms Practice By Our Members, Their Guests, And Local Law Enforcement Personnel.   The Current Range Location Was Established By Verbal Agreement In 1994, And A Formal Lease Agreement Was Signed In 2003.  The Lease Is Effective Until 2043.</p>

                    <p>We Are Constantly Working To Develop A Plan For Using The Property And Goals For What We Want To Accomplish In The Next Several Years. We Encourage Everyone To Attend The Meetings And Actively Participate In This Decision-Making Process.</p>
                    <p>In 2005, We Graveled The Road And A Firing Line. In 2006, We Installed Concrete Shooting Benches Along The Firing Line. We Also Began Cowboy Town. In 2007, We Obtained An Oregon Department Of Fish And Wildlife (ODFW) Grant For A 400-Yard Berm And A Permanent, Handicapped Bathroom. Our 2010 ODFW Grant Funds Helped Us Get An Automatic Gate System. In 2023, We Rebuilt The Pistol Bay Walls, Replacing Deteriorating Hay Bales With Concrete Blocks, As Well As Improving The Drainage.  We Also Installed The Range Office For Use During Events And To Store Supplies.</p>
